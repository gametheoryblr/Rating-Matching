A I had called about an hour back for booking the badminton coaching. Change the time with 06:00 or anything after six is available.
B After 06:00 we don't do not have a slot. That's why I gave you five.
A Okay.
B Tomorrow evening.
A Tomorrow I'll be having office actually.
B Okay. 04:00.
A Morning slot is there for tomorrow.
B One moment, let me just check. Today 05:00 p.m. Is not possible.
A No, actually I have given my scooty for repairing right now.
B Okay.
A I thought I'll get it before five.
B Okay, let me just check for tomorrow morning and I'll call you.
A Okay, sure.
B Okay. Yeah. Thank you.
