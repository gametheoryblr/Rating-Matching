B Good afternoon. Game theory. How may I help you today? Yes, very good. Afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, sir. I'm planning for a spending clothes for my kid which is five years old. Sir, we have the plan, sir. For kids starting from eight months. In 3.5 years the fees would be 5000 999. This classes will be done only on a weekend, sir.
A And it will be eight classes. Yeah. Weekends.
B Okay.
A Duration, sir, duration will be half an hour.
B Half an hour, sir. Whether the training will be on individual or in the group, sir, group.
A Sir, we have six people in the batch. Okay. Along with the parents. With the kid with costumes. Okay.
B And is it sufficient for this class? Will be enough to learn swimming? I don't know. Even we don't know what.
A No. For small kid it will take time because the movement should be slow. Right. They are not like adults. Right. So it'll take time. But they can move hands. They can freeze. They can swim. They can do a lot of activity in swimming. The fear factor will be removed. Okay.
B Okay.
A That's the idea behind.
