A Good afternoon.
B Game.
A Kerry.
B Hello.
A Yes.
B Good morning, ma'am. I just wanted to know the swimming pool near BP Varia Road, ma'am. I wanted to know the details regarding the timings and fee structure for the swimming.
A For yourself?
B Yes. It's not for me, ma'am.
A It's for my son. Okay. What's your name?
B My name is Preeti.
A Preeti. Okay, fine. I'll tell you the details. We conduct the microphone swimming program. This is the first structured program for both kids and adults. And classes are held from Tuesday to Sunday.
B Okay. Monday is a leave, is it? Yeah.
A Monday it's closed.
B Okay.
A Yeah, let me know.
B Ma'am.
A Yeah. In this program, the coach student ratio is one is to six. And what we would first like to do is we would like to invite the child for a free trial class. Okay. In this free trial class, the coach will get into the water. Along with them. We'll assess your breathing skills. How comfortable you are in the water. I think you had called us.
B This is for Tanish, correct? Yes. You had called us on January.
A 23.
B Yes. But I could not get the location, ma'am. Because I don't know where exactly it is. So I was asking for the location. This thing also on this phone number only if you can send to WhatsApp. So at least I can trace the location and go. Hello.
