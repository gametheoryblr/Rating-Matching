A Good afternoon.
B Welcome to Mc.
A How may I help you today?
B Hello. Hi. I had an appointment today for, like, a free trial. Okay. In the name of Craig Jan. Can you just check and let me know.
A Sir? You can walk in directly, sir. If the appointment scheduled, fixed for free trial, you can go directly, sir.
B Okay. The appointment is.
A In six. Yeah. Which means whatever.
B Request we have taken.
A We have sent it to the concerned location and they'll have the list. Okay. So you can directly walk in this.
B Okay, cool.
A Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.
