A Good afternoon. Game theory.
B Yeah, good afternoon, ma'am. Actually, I'm calling from Kodihali. I was looking for a place to put my grandchildren for swimming classes. Do you have. I was told that you have a swimming pool.
A Yes, we have one at Yemblur and one at Kabdaspura.
C Okay.
B I think that will be closer to Kodihali. Probably near Indra, right?
C Yes. Okay.
B Do you have coaching sessions ongoing or. I want it after 26th. Because their exams are just starting from tomorrow. Their school closes by 26th of this month.
C Okay.
B So I thought maybe by 1st April if they join. Or a month end if they join. Something like that. How many classes is it?
A What's your name, please? And how old are your grandchildren?
B Yeah, one is ten years and one is seven years.
A 27. No, ten and seven.
B Okay. Ten and seven.
C Yeah.
B Okay.
A So Radhika, I'll tell you the details. We conduct the Michael Phelps swimming program. This is the first structured program for both kids and adults. Classes are held from Tuesday to Sunday in the evening at 4440 and 520.
C Okay.
A Four to 444, 40 to 520 and 520 to six. In this program, the coach student ratio is one is to six. And what we would first like to do is we would like to invite the kids for a free trial class.
C Okay.
A In the free trial class, the coach will get into the water along with the kids. We'll assess their breathing skills, how comfortable they are in the water and then suggest as to which level. The batch availability and other details. For the free trial, they require the swimming costume and the swim cap. Okay.
B Normally, what is the time? Is there any particular time slot or something to come for a trial?
A Yeah, the timings that I mentioned.
B Only that time only. We have to come. So weekend also is possible to come?
A Yes. And weekends we have a morning batch at nine and 940 on Saturday. Sundays.
C Okay.
A So you can give us a call a day prior and we'll schedule the free trial.
C Okay.
B And what is the duration of the classes? It must be a plan kind of a thing, right?
A Yeah, we have two plans. One is the gold plan which consists of 48 classes. Six month validity and the pricing is 18,000. And the silver plan is 24 classes, two month validity and the pricing is 12,000.
C Okay.
B May I know your good name?

C Okay.
B Sorry.
C Ellis.
A Okay.
B If you can, please. My number has WhatsApp. Can you just send me those plan details and the class duration details? What about in case? Okay, you said validity is there for two months. So they have to finish it within that time.
