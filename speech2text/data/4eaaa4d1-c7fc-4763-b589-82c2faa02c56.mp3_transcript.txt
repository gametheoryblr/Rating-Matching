B One is to.
A Mix gender. And what we would first like to do is we would like to invite you for a free trial class. In the free trial class the coach will get into the water along with you. We'll assess your breathing skills, how comfortable you are in the water and then suggest as to which level you have to start with the batch availability and other details.
B Got it. What will be the charges and how many classes will be?
A We have two plans. One is the gold plan which consists of 48 classes, six month validity and the pricing is 18,000. And the silver plan is 24 classes, two month validity and the pricing is 12,000.
B Okay.
C Yeah.
B So do you have any discounts or anything for couples? Because we are two people. Me and my husband wants to join.
A Once you do the trial class, post the trial, the front desk manager will work out some discount for you.
C Okay.
B And is this all days a week? Any day we can come or is it.
A No, you can come minimum three days a week. You have to remain constant at one timing because as I mentioned we take only six students per coach.
