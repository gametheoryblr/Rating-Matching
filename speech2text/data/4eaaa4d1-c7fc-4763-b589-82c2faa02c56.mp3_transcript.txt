A Good afternoon game theory.
B Hi, I wanted to inquire regarding the classes.
A Okay, what's your name please? And which location are you looking at?
B I see hoodie. Whitefield. Do you have anything whitefield?
A No, not in white field but the closest for you would be only. You'll have to check out the location on Google Maps.
C Okay.
B And what all locations you have?
A We have BTM, Basrangudi, JP Nagar, Yamlur and Kabdaspura. Whitefield. We do not have swimming.
B What are the timings for adults?
A We have morning 627, 40 and 820 and evening 6640 and 720. We conduct the microphelp swimming program. And in this program the coach student ratio is one is to six.
B One is to.
A Mix gender. And what we would first like to do is we would like to invite you for a free trial class. In the free trial class the coach will get into the water along with you. We'll assess your breathing skills, how comfortable you are in the water and then suggest as to which level you have to start with the batch availability and other details.
B Got it. What will be the charges and how many classes will be?
A We have two plans. One is the gold plan which consists of 48 classes, six month validity and the pricing is 18,000. And the silver plan is 24 classes, two month validity and the pricing is 12,000.
B Okay.
C Yeah.
B So do you have any discounts or anything for couples? Because we are two people. Me and my husband wants to join.
A Once you do the trial class, post the trial, the front desk manager will work out some discount for you.
C Okay.
B And is this all days a week? Any day we can come or is it.
A No, you can come minimum three days a week. You have to remain constant at one timing because as I mentioned we take only six students per coach.
B How deep will be the pool?
A It's 4ft deep throughout in Yamur.
C 4Ft deep.
B Only 4ft?
C Yes.
A For lap swimming it has to be only 4ft. Minimum 4ft.
B Okay, thank you. Okay.
C Yeah. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Bye.
